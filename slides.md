from Computer Science (CS)

<!--
Good morning. We are students from NTNU Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering.

My name is 子緯, and our team member 博傑, 宗翰 and 宇呈.

In this presentation, we're going to introduce A VERY VERY COOL thing, REGULAR EXPRESSION, An Essential and Powerful string processsing tool for programmers.

# Outline

1. What is Regex? & Why Regex?
2. The Syntax of Regex
3. Regex Challenges!
4. How does it work?

<!--
Firstly, we'll talk about what is regex? and why we need regex?

Secondly, we'll introduce the syntax of regex

Then, we'll have some challenges for you to exercise.

Finally, we'll briefly explain how regex works.

we'll also explain some technical term when needed.

# Imagine that...

1. Senior student (ID begins with '407')
2. College of Science (ID ends with 'S' or 's')

<br><br><br><br>

### How will you do that?

---

# Pseudo code

```python
for each student_id in student_list:
    if (student_id is begin with '407') and (student_id is end with 's' or end with 'S'):
        # valid ID
    else:
        # invalid ID
```

<br><br><br>

### Looks really simple, right?

### pseudo code
It is just a plain desciption of algorithm which looks like code.  
e.g. The python code has 87% similarity of the pseudo code.

Vocabulary  

- pseudo code
  : In computer science, pseudocode is not a programming language, it is not a valid code. but it can describe an algorithm to others. it is just plain desciption which looks like code.  
  example:
    The python code has 87% similarity of the pseudo code.

# Trap Card ACTIVATED!

1. Juinor students (ID begins with '408')
2. College of Techonology and Engineering  
  (ID ends with 'H' or 'h')

<br><br><br>

### So..we need to rewrite the code.

---

# Revised source code

```python
for each student_id in student_list:
    if (((student_id is begin with '407') or (student_id is begin with '408')) and
        ((student_id is end with 's' or end with 'S') or (student_id is end with 'h' or end with 'H'))):
        # valid ID
    else:
        # invalid ID
```

<br><br><br>

### Well... It looks a little more complicated now.

---

# The problems

1. Engineers are lazy. We don't want to write similar code multiple times.
2. Engineers are lazy. We don't want to read code written by others.
3. You have to be able to write programs before you can search.
4. Give user the ability to execute code is dangerous.

<!-- 
Vocabulary

- compile
  : to change a computer program into a machine language.
  example:
    Please don't compile the identical source code twice and except
    the error will disappear. Go to fix your code!

# Regex

The life-saver of pattern matching

# Refactor with regex

```python
for each student_id in student_list:
    if match student_id with "40[78].*[sh]/i":
        # valid ID
    else:
        # invalid ID
```

<v-clicks>

```python
for each student_id in student_list:
    if (((student_id is begin with '407') or (student_id is begin with '408')) and
        ((student_id is end with 's' or end with 'S') or (student_id is end with 'h' or end with 'H'))):
        # valid ID
    else:
        # invalid ID
```

### refactor
(verb) restructure the source code of an application or piece of software so as to improve operation without altering functionality.    
e.g. Sometimes, developers prefer to rewrite from scratch rather than refactor legacy code because they cannot even understand what they just wrote 3 days ago.

# What is regex?

- regex is a sequence of characters that specifies a search pattern.
- regex patterns are commonly used by string-searching algorithms
- e.g:
	- "find" or "find and replace" operations
	- input validation.

# Why must be regex?

- Clean (A pattern is worth a thousand codes)
- Standard (widely used)
- Be a Lifehacker!

# Syntax

layout: image-right

---

# Quick Start

---

# Spectial Characters
- `. ` dot
- `()` parentheses
- `[]` brackets
- `{}` braces
- `\ ` backward slash, escape character
- `+ ` plus sign
- `* ` asterisk (people love calling it star)
- `? ` question mark
- `| ` pipe sign
- `^ ` caret

---

class: text-center

# exact match

<demo defaultPattern="" defaultFlags="" defaultText="I have a fat cat called Matt as a pet. It caught a rat." />

<!-- 
let's match 'at' & add flag 'g' which means global, that is, match all occurence in text instead of only matching first one.
 -->

---
layout: center
class: text-center
---

# `.` dot
Match any single character.

<demo defaultPattern="cap" defaultFlags="g" :defaultText="'I have a cap and a cup.\nI have a fat cat called Matt as a pet. It caught a rat.'" />

<!-- 
then we can use dot to match any single character.
for example, /c.p/ matches both 'cap' and 'cup'.
 -->

---
layout: center
class: text-center
---

# `[]` character class
Match any one of the enclosed characters

<demo defaultPattern="" defaultFlags="g" defaultText="I have a fat cat called Matt as a pet. It caught a rat that weight 20 grams." />

<!-- 
we can use character class to contain multiple characters
like /[fcMr]at/
and we can use range, such as a-z, A-Z, 0-9, 0-1
also, in order to match dot, we need this [.]
 -->

---
layout: center
class: text-center
---

# `\` escape character


**\d** match digit, **\w** match alphanumeric character  
**\s** match whitespace, **\b** match boundary

<demo defaultPattern="\d" defaultFlags="g" :defaultText="'What is 24.0 \ 12.0 = ?\nIt\'s 2.\nCorrect!'" />

<!-- 
back slash means escape, what escape means is that the character after back slash is escaping from the original meaning
for example, another way to match a dot is using escape \.

apple not apples
 -->

---
layout: center
class: text-center
---

# `|` logical OR

<demo defaultPattern="" defaultFlags="g" :defaultText="'40747024s\n40847019S'" />

---
layout: center
class: text-center
---

# `()` Grouping

<demo defaultPattern="407|8470" defaultFlags="g" :defaultText="'40747007s\n40847007S'" />

<!-- 
two usages

1. prior
2. capture

\1 match 1st group, \2 match 2nd group

1*1=1 1*2=2 1*3=3
2*1=2 2*2=4 2*3=6
3*1=3 3*2=6 3*3=9
 -->

---
layout: center
class: text-center
---

# `?` allow 0 or 1 times
optional

<demo defaultPattern="" defaultFlags="g" :defaultText="'abc.ppt\nabc.pptx\nhe is good\nshe is god'" />

---
layout: center
class: text-center
---

# `*` allow 0 or many times
any number of times

<demo defaultPattern="" defaultFlags="g" :defaultText="'hw1_jimmy.pdf\nhw1_bob.pdf\nhw2_alice.pdf\nhw2_bob.docx'" />

---
layout: center
class: text-center
---

# `+` allow 1 or many times
at least one times

<demo defaultPattern="@gmail.com" defaultFlags="g" :defaultText="'alice@gmail.com\n@gmail.com'" />

---
layout: center
class: text-center
---

# `{min, max}` explicit counts

<demo defaultPattern="" defaultFlags="g" :defaultText="'pswd\npasswd\npassword\nlong_password'" />

---
layout: center
class: text-center
---

# `^` negation, do the opposite

<demo defaultPattern="[\w]att?" defaultFlags="g" :defaultText="'rat\nMatt\nhat\ncat'" />
